Starting The Game:

To start the game, open __main__.py

Controls:

On the bottom left is your map. There you can see yourself(blue), items you could pick up(green), enemies(red),
traders(pink), doors(brown), and the castle(white). You can only open doors with a chamber key.
You can only move inside the dungeon and can walk over items to interact with them.
If you get too close to an enemy, it will attack. To move around the map, press w, s, a, and d.
To open a door, walk up to it. To interact with an npc or pick up an item, walk over it.

When in a fight, you can attack by pressing "k" or use an item by pressing "o".


On the bottom right are your stats. This includes your health, armour, and damage. It also includes the items you have
equipped, and the items in your inventory and their descriptions. To navigate through the items in your inventory, press
the up and down arrow keys. To use an item, press "O", and to drop an item, press "P". If you drop an item, you
can pick it up again in the map. Once you use an object, it is removed from your inventory.

At the top is the dialogue box. It prints any dialogue you will have to see in the video game.
Sometimes, a window will pop up with a box for a response. You can type something into this window and the
game will respond to it. The dialogue box clears after a certain amount of lines have been printed.




Enjoy the Game!
